# TI99-4a-Joystick-Adapter
Joystick adapter to allow play with standard Atari type sticks


Here is my PCB design for a Joystick adapter to allow play with standard Atari sticks on a TI99/4a computer.

The gerber files for manufacturing the PCB can be found in the

file

You can find the STL files for my 3D printed housing on my Thingiverse.

I have included pictures of all parts required for the build.

I hope that this is of some use to you.
